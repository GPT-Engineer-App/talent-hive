Project Description - Frontend:
As an integral part of the intelligent system for automating the job-candidate matching process, the frontend application plays a pivotal role in providing a seamless and intuitive user experience for HR managers. The primary objective of the frontend is to offer a user-friendly interface that enables efficient interaction with the system's underlying data and functionality.

Application Modes:
The frontend application is designed with two main modes: "View Candidates" and "View Jobs." Each mode tailors the user interface to cater specifically to the distinct needs of HR managers when reviewing candidates or job descriptions.

View Candidates Mode:

In this mode, HR managers can explore a comprehensive list of potential employees.
Clicking on a candidate reveals their detailed profile, including relevant information such as their name, qualifications, work experience, and scores for different jobs.
Candidate profiles are presented in a user-friendly format, making it effortless for HR managers to assess their suitability for various positions.
Candidates are ranked based on their scores for specific jobs, facilitating quick identification of the most suitable applicants.
View Jobs Mode:

HR managers can browse a list of available job openings in this mode.
Selecting a job displays its detailed description, encompassing job responsibilities, requirements, and other pertinent details.
Additionally, the system presents a ranked list of the best-suited candidates for that particular job, with their scores, enabling HR managers to efficiently identify promising applicants.
User Interface and Functionality:
Search, Filter, and Sort: Users can effortlessly search for specific candidates or jobs using keywords. Advanced filtering options allow HR managers to narrow down results based on various criteria, such as job type, location, or specific skill sets. Sorting mechanisms further enhance the ability to organize and prioritize candidates or jobs based on scores or other attributes.

Data Presentation: The frontend application visually presents job descriptions, candidate resumes, and their corresponding scores in a clear and concise manner. This includes well-designed data tables, charts, or graphs, ensuring HR managers can easily grasp the information at a glance.

User-Friendly Navigation: The application's navigation is intuitive and straightforward, allowing users to seamlessly switch between the "View Candidates" and "View Jobs" modes. Breadcrumbs or similar navigation aids ensure users can effortlessly track their path within the application.

Responsive Design: The frontend is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction across various devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Real-time Updates: The frontend dynamically updates as changes occur in the backend, ensuring that HR managers always work with the most current data.

Technical Implementation:
API Integration: The frontend application communicates with the backend APIs to retrieve and update data. It fetches job descriptions, candidate resumes, and their scores, ensuring seamless synchronization between the two components.
